  <p>
    The Portuguese Primatology Association (APP) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the study and promotion of knowledge about non-human primates and their conservation. Founded in 2004 with the aim of bringing together researchers, students and enthusiasts in the various areas of primatology, from evolution to behavior and welfare, among others, APP plays a role in the scientific investigation of our closest relatives, facilitating cooperation between all those working in the field, both in Portugal and abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
    APP's mission includes not only advancing scientific research in primatology, but also educating the public about the subject, namely the importance of conserving the various species of non-human primates, many of which face high extinction risk due to habitat loss and destruction, poaching and other environmental threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    The association regularly holds workshops and scientific and educational events that allow its members and the wider public to deepen their knowledge of primates and discuss effective and ethical strategies for their study and protection. In addition, APP collaborates with other national and international associations with objectives similar to its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    With an ongoing commitment to scientific excellence and ensuring civic and environmental responsibility, the Portuguese Primatology Association plays a vital role in researching and disseminating knowledge about non-human primates, as well as defending their welfare and survival.

    Dear Fellow Primates,
  </p>
  <p>
    Welcome to the IX Iberian Primatological Conference, which will take place from November 21 to 23 in the beautiful town of Vila do Conde, Portugal! 
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope you have a wonderful time during our event. It's a time for learning about us and other primates, exchanging experiences, creating networks, and even finding new friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join us in exploring Vila do Conde and participating in this event. You can attend high-standard scientific talks given by our invited speakers, present your work (oral communications or posters) and receive feedback, exchange dreams with other primatologists, and who knows, maybe even achieve them!

  <p>
    The coastal town of Vila do Conde is one of the oldest settlements in northern Portugal. Its origins date back further than the foundation of Portuguese territory, with the first written document mentioning Villa de Comite dating back to 953, in a letter of sale of goods by Flamula Deo-Vota to the Monastery of Guimarães. The Monastery of Santa Clara, a monument that was restored and enlarged in the 18th century, is a “must-see” and Vila do Conde’s ex-libris.
  </p>
  </p>
    You may need to “take it easy” with Vila do Conde's exquisite gastronomy, which reflects its geographical location by the sea and its rich agricultural region. Particularly popular are the "petinga à moda das Caxinas" and a variety of fish and shellfish, savory meat dishes, and the fresh, natural milk from the local farms. Delicious appetizers and delicacies may distract you from the main dishes.
  </p>
  </p>
    Convent sweets are a centuries-old tradition in Vila do Conde. The convents and monasteries were the main drivers of these traditions from an early age, and Vila do Conde is an example of this, with the monasteries of Santa Clara and Vairão. Among its many specialties, the egg sweets stand out along with “rosca de folar da Páscoa.” There are also several restaurants that offer vegetarian options for those who follow a vegetarian diet.
  </p>
  </p>
    Vila do Conde’s exquisite art crafts include “rendas de bilros” and Fishermen's woollens. The latter will protect you from the cold weather during our congress.

IXIPC-photo-competition = Cláudia Sousa photography competition
IXIPC-photo-competition-description = 
  <p>Since our colleague Cláudia left us in 2014, we decided to organize a photo competition in her honour at every congress. This was one of the ways we chose to keep her permanently in our memory as the APP/APE congresses go by.</p>
  <p>Cláudia was one of the first primatologists in the country and was also a founding member of APP. She was involved in all the APP and APP/APE congresses and activities, and in her work she always tried to involve Portuguese students in particular. After all, contrary to PhD students from other countries, many of us find it difficult to study primates in their natural habitats. That is  how our “field station” in Guinea-Bissau was born: not only as a way of having a research space for Portuguese students to work in natural habitats without waiting lists, but also to involve Guinean students. That spirit, those values and that idea, which was innovative at the time - and which benefited many Portuguese students - remains in our minds. Even when research is done outside Guinea-Bissau, the principles applied are the same.</p>
  <p>We hope that these photo competitions will continue to remind us of our “Caia” and her magnificent work. In her honour, here is the contest for this congress, which follows the rules of previous contests:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Anyone interested in entering must tick the relevant option on the registration form on our website and mention it on the first day of the congress, when the event materials are handed out. This means that, in order to enter, the candidate must be registered for the congress and the photo competition;</li>
    <li>It is also on the first day of the congress, at registration, that each candidate hands in their photo, its caption (containing the year the photo was taken and where) and adhesive material of their choice;</li>
    <li>Each candidate can only submit one photograph;</li>
    <li>Photographs made from camera images or digitally modified are not allowed;</li>
    <li>The author is always responsible for choosing the print size of the photograph;</li>
    <li>Photographs may contain non-human primates in their natural habitat or in colonies, such as zoos, laboratories, sanctuaries and other places.</li>
  </ol>
